Croissant
=========

Croissant is a simple, minimal, lightweight blogging app written for the Laravel 
framework. The project takes inspiration from Eric Barnes's [Wardrobe](https://github.com/ericbarnes/wardrobe),
but strays away from some of the more advanced techniques Eric has implemented
with Wardrobe. The main purpose of Croissant is to provide a learning ground for 
myself (and hopefully others) for writing basic apps using the Laravel framework,
while at the same time providing a functional and usable app.
